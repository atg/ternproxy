  "readme": "# findpkg\n\nFinds the package descriptor file for a module.\n\n## Overview\n\nNode.js packages are specified by a directory containing a `package.json` descriptor file. The top-level package directory as well as the package name are frequently required by logging utilities and configuration file managers. The `findpkg` function returns an object providing this information.\n\n## Features\n\nThe `findpkg` utility offers the following features:\n\n1. Given a module, finds the directory containing the `package.json` file.\n2. Parses the package name from the `package.json` file.\n3. Provides a `resolve` method that resolves filenames against the package directory (includes special handling of filenames prefixed with a dot).\n4. Provides fallback behavior if the module is not part of a package.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using NPM.\n\n    npm install findpkg\n\n(Or add it to your dependencies.)\n\n## API\n\nCalling `require('findpkg')` returns a function taking a module.\n\n```javascript\nvar findpkg = require('findpkg');\nvar pkginfo = findpkg(module);\n```\n\n*Parameters:*\n\n- `module` - {Object} The module (i.e., `module` or `module.parent`).\n\n*Returns:*\n\nReturns an object having the following five components:\n\n1. `found` - {Boolean} Set to true if a package descriptor file was found. (See API notes below.)\n2. `name` - {String} The name property from the package descriptor file.\n3. `pathname` - {String} The pathname of the package descriptor file.\n4. `dirname` - {String} The directory name of the package descriptor file (the top-level directory of the package).\n5. `resolve` - {Function} Resolves a filename against the `dirname` unless the filename is prefixed with a dot (i.e., `./` or `../`), in which case the current working directory is used.\n\n*Errors:*\n\n- Throws an exception if the argument is not a module or if the package descriptor file (if found) cannot be parsed.\n\n*Note:*\n\nIf no `package.json` file is found, then the return value is populated from the  `module` parameter as follows:\n\n- The `found` property is set to false.\n- The `name` is set to the basename portion of the module's filename (without the extension).\n- The `pathname` is set to the value of the module's filename.\n- The `dirname` is set to the directory portion of the module's filename.\n- The `resolve` function still resolves against the `dirname` (no change).\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Frank Hellwig\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
